				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div id="bioHrLine"></div>
				<img id="profilePicture" src="assets/images/Evgheni_Pascalov.jpg" alt="Evgheni Pascalov" >
				
				<p>Just six months ago I was sitting in the lobby of Wake Forest University waiting for my MBA interview. That’s what it felt like I had to do. You go to college, you find a great job soon after. A couple of years later, you go to get your Masters degree and you end up with an even better job. And all of this is great, if you know that you were on the right path from the very beginning. But that wasn’t my case.</p>
				
				<p>I think deciding to become a web developer has been the biggest and most important step in my life. And it was the right step. I got my Bachelors degree in Finance and Economics but never learn how to paint. Programing made me a Van Gogh.</p>
				
				<p>So, currently I am attending the Boot Camp at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and so far I am loving it. I love the city, love the College, love the professors and I can not wait to see what’s next. And by the way, the MBA interview went well. </p>
				<p>A couple of fun facts about me: - I played basketball for the Junior National team back in Europe - Before I started the boot camp I spoke 4 languages and I can’t wait to find out how many I am going to learn by the end of the program.</p>
